- The code works perfectly well. Please give significant time if you want to search for end-to-end coordinates.

- Steps to run the code:
    - In a folder, download both the obstacle_gen.py and Astar.py files.
    - In a new terminal, run python3 Astar.py

- In pygame, the window origin is the top left corner. I have adjusted this for the visualziation.
